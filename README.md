## [](#motivation)Motivation

A CMS **shouldn not** be the defining feature of a webapp. Nighter should Ecommerce or anything other than your code. \
ERP integration **shouldn not** force developer to cut corners.

- Jaen **does not** interfere with **your** user experience.
- Jean **does not** challange **your** application design.
- Jaen gives the power back to **you**.

One thing and one thing only with clean and well documented interfaces.
Customizable, extensible and open-source.

**Msg inspiring ppl:** \
Chasing ones own tail is not inspiring.

**Disclaimer:** \
Not for crybabies. Do not touch if you are affraid to be a bit scratche.

## [](#quick-start)Quick start

Several quick start options are available:

- Generate repository from template: [Generate Jaen on github](https://github.com/snek-shipyard/jaen-template/generate)

### Codespace setup

The easiest method is to use a GitHub [Codespace](https://github.com/features/codespaces) (in beta). Just create a GitHub Codespace from the Code menu. Wait for the Codespace to complete provisioning. When the Codespace has completed provisioning open a terminal window (Ctrl-`, Control-backquote) and:

- Start a local copy of the docs site with `npm start`
- Or build a local copy of the library with `npm run build`

### Local setup

If you set this up locally, make sure you have the following pre-requisites:

- Add github npm registry: npm login --registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com
- Use `npm install` to install all dependencies
- Start a local copy of the docs site with `npm start`
- Or build a local copy of the library with `npm run build`

The demo site will now be accessible at <http://localhost:3000/>.
